### Tree-sitter SQL
---

This is a tree-sitter grammar for SQL.

This grammar is still in development and is not ready for use. It's currently being used for a project I'm working on
and is foucused on the PostgreSQL dialect. For now I will also only focus on select statements as the project this is
being used for is an data engineering tool.
